There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.
 
In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.
 
Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.
 
Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.
 
Example 1:
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
 
Example 2:
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
 
Example 3:
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55

## THE LOGIC FOR THE CODE IS AS FOLLOWS :-

We can sum all the elements from the beginning and from the end, we can track the sums and then find the maximum score after combining the sums.

1. We will iterate thru the array and first calculate the sum of first 'i' cards from range 0 to k.
for i in range(k):
    first_sums[i] = first_sums[i] + cardPoints[i]

2. We will again iterate thru the array and now calculate the sum of last 'i' cards from range 0 to k.
for i in range(k):
    last_sums[i] = last_sums[i] - cardPoints[len(cardPoints) - 1 - i]

## BOTH THE ABOVE ARRAYS SHOULD BE OF SIZE (K+1) AND INITIALY ALL THE ELEMENTS BE 0

3. Now we will compare the max score out of the two first_sums and last_sums using the max() function.

After combining these scores we will find the maximum score and return it.
